## Project Overview
This project aims to identify patterns within comments on trending videos in the United Kingdom taken from YouTube. The data were taken from the Kaggle website
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube). This dataset is decomposed into two datasets, the first collecting all comments, the other describing the video through features. In this project, through data cleaning techniques, engineering, and finally through text analysis, I want to find out what content a video should carry in order to go viral. This project has no commercial purpose and is just a way to train me with data handling techniques.
